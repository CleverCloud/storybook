This is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) demo by Clever Cloud.

This project is configured in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The app uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ðŸš€ Deploy on Clever Cloud
 
 Storybook is deployed easily on a Node.js runtime on Clever Cloud. No add-on is needed.

 [ðŸ“– Check our Node.js documentation for further configuration](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/deploy/application/javascript/by-framework/nodejs/)
